## DESCRIPTION:

cf '[*The indisputable existence of Santa Claus*](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/1784162744/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_r111FbZHY8VJG)' by Dr Hannah Fry, Chapter 4 '*Secret Santa*' (p.46 to 54; ISBN 9781784162740).
This exercice tends to define a Random Hat Picking assignment of a Secret Santa, to another participant.

In this short exercice, we just simply create a pool, according to the number of participants, a randomly paired number ID with some other number ID.
Then a pair is Randomly pulled out of the Bag (Pool list), and printed to the screen.

That way each Santa is randomly assigned to a participant.

### User Scenario 1, Paper
***Outcome of secretsanta.py***

In a real life situation, we should print out the Secret Santa Pairing list, cut the different strips of pairs. People picks in a sorting hat.
Then We just list Who they are (not who they offer to), either right after sorting their pairs, or right before opening presents (Adding a bit of mistery).

### User Scenario 3, Auto-email

***Outcome of secretSantaEmail.py***

As it is all managed and randomised by a computer, we could create a script with names assignements. Same random pairing script, then email/sms each pairs to the concerned secret santa, leaving no traces.
